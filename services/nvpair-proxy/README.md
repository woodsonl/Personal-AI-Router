# Engine Proxy

A discovery-aware HTTP reverse proxy that fronts every enabled inference engine.
It runs no mDNS browse of its own: routing targets come from the broker's
discovery relay (each facade sends `discovery:subscribe` for its engine's
service key and replaces its routing overlay from each pushed `discovery:nodes`
snapshot) plus user-added manual nodes. It forwards HTTP requests to the
selected node, aggregates the model-list routes across candidate nodes, and
exposes a bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0 control channel over stdio (or an IPC
socket).

**One process, one facade per engine.** The process starts with no engine and no
listener; the broker asks for each engine's facade with `facade/enable`, which
carries that engine's port and alias addresses. A flag cannot express this,
because the broker plans a different port for each engine.

They share a process on purpose. Between scheduler snapshots a facade takes
short-lived reservations for work it has dispatched, and those live in the
process — a process per engine split that picture, so simultaneous bursts on
both engines could pick the same node believing it idle.

The cost is shared fate for the **process**: a crash takes every facade down and
the supervisor restarts them together. Smaller failures are contained to one
engine — a lost bind race, a port that cannot be re-listened, or a panic while
handling a request. Each of those used to end the process, which was fine when
the process was one engine.

`spec.md` is normative; where it and this file disagree, it wins. Everything
below is shared behavior unless a section says otherwise.

## Build

```bash
go build -o nvpair-proxy .
```

## Usage

```
nvpair-proxy [flags]
```

Then, over the control channel, for each engine to front:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"facade/enable",
 "params":{"engine":"ollama","port":11434,"ignorePersistedPort":true}}
```

The response is `{"engine":"ollama","port":11434}`, reporting the port actually
bound — enable is a request, and the child's persisted-port restore can override
the port asked for. Enabling an engine that is already up is an idempotent
success, so a redelivered enable never tears down a working listener.

### Flags

Only process-scoped settings are flags. Anything per-engine is a `facade/enable`
parameter, because one flag cannot carry two engines' plans.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--ipc` | *(empty — use stdio)* | Path to a Unix domain socket or Windows named pipe for IPC |
| `--cluster-dir` | *(empty)* | Cluster trust directory (`node.crt`/`node.key` plus trusted pins). Enables the LAN mTLS inference ingress while this node is a cluster member; empty means no ingress and no peer candidates. |
| `--log-level` | *(`$NVPAIR_LOG_LEVEL`, else `info`)* | Initial log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. Changeable at runtime with `log/set-level`. |
| `--version` | | Print version and exit |

### `facade/enable` parameters

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `engine` | *(required)* | Which engine to front: `ollama` or `lmstudio`. An unknown name is rejected with the accepted values. |
| `port` | per engine, see below | HTTP listen port for request forwarding. Must be 1–65535, or omitted for the engine's standalone default. `0` means "the default" rather than "pick an ephemeral port", and any other out-of-range value is rejected, because the facade announces the requested port in its `ready` notification and the broker would be told `0`. |
| `aliasAddresses` | *(empty)* | Optional secondary `host:port` values for the same routing handler, one per loopback family so `localhost` resolves either way. Only literal loopback addresses are accepted; the broker uses this for a safe inherited local `OLLAMA_HOST`, and the aliases are not advertised to peers. Accepted only for an engine with an inherited host variable — today Ollama alone — and rejected for any other. |
| `ignorePersistedPort` | `false` | Use `port` even when a saved port exists (used by broker-managed startup) |

### What differs per engine

Everything engine-specific is one entry in `engines.go`, plus the shared
identity in `nvpair-shared/engines`.

| | `"engine":"ollama"` | `"engine":"lmstudio"` |
|---|---|---|
| Facade id — error-ID prefix, broker relay namespace, TUI proxies-view tab | `ollama-proxy` | `lmstudio-proxy` |
| Discovery service key | `ol` | `lm` |

The **log component, supervisor label, and TUI health crash key are not in that
table**: they name the process (`nvpair-proxy`), not a facade, because one
process hosts every engine and there is no single engine to attribute them to.
Facade-scoped log records carry an `engine` field instead. The supervisor label
and the health crash key are matched against each other, so they move together
— see `nvpair-shared/engines` and `spec.md` §9.

| | `"engine":"ollama"` | `"engine":"lmstudio"` |
|---|---|---|
| Engine's own client-facing port | 11434 | 1234 |
| Where PAIR relocates the engine | 11435 | 1235 |
| Standalone port, used when `port` is omitted | 11435 | 1234 |
| Persisted-port file (declared, not derived) | `proxy-port.json` | `lmstudio-proxy-port.json` |
| Model-list routes | `GET /api/tags` (native), `GET /v1/models` (OpenAI) | `GET /v1/models` (OpenAI) |
| Inference routes | `/api/generate`, `/api/chat`, `/api/embeddings`, `/api/embed`, plus the OpenAI set | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings` |
| Model naming | untagged means `:latest`, so `llama3` and `llama3:latest` are one model | identifiers compared byte for byte |

The route table is a **classifier, not an allowlist**. An unlisted path is
forwarded verbatim, which is how `/api/show`, `/api/pull`, `/api/ps`,
`/api/version` and `OPTIONS` preflights keep working.

### HTTP Reverse Proxy

A facade listens on its enabled port and forwards incoming requests to the
currently active node — except the model-list routes, which are queried across
every candidate node concurrently and merged into one de-duplicated inventory.
Point your client at the proxy and it handles routing.

Inbound request bodies are buffered once so each failover attempt can replay them. That buffer is capped at 32 MiB: a larger body is refused with `413` before any candidate is resolved or forwarded, rather than read into memory unbounded. Long-context prompts fit far below the cap.

When the broker supplies `aliasAddresses`, the facade reserves that
loopback-only endpoint before reporting ready and serves it through the same
routing and workload-lifecycle handler. A `localhost` alias reserves `127.0.0.1`
and `::1` atomically so client resolution cannot bypass the router. An occupied
alias is non-fatal: its existing owner is untouched and the proxy reports an
actionable warning while the primary listener stays available.

**Cluster ingress.** The listener carries two personalities, demultiplexed by
each connection's first byte. Plaintext HTTP is accepted only from loopback; a
LAN caller is refused. When `--cluster-dir` shows this node is a cluster member,
the same listener also terminates cluster mTLS: a peer whose client certificate
matches one of this node's pins is forwarded straight to the local engine
reported by `node/set-local-backend`, and is never re-routed onward to another
node. Membership and pins are re-derived per request, so joining or leaving a
cluster needs no restart.

**Persisted port.** A port chosen at runtime via `set-port` is saved to the
per-user data dir (`%LocalAppData%\Nvidia Corporation\Personal AI Router` on
Windows, `~/.config/Nvidia Corporation/Personal AI Router` on Linux) and
**restored when the facade is enabled**, taking precedence over the requested
`port`/the default — so the proxy comes back up where it was last put. Each
engine has its own file, so moving one proxy never moves another.
`ignorePersistedPort` deliberately bypasses that restoration for a
broker-coordinated start. Delete the file (or
`set-port` back to the default) to revert.

LM Studio additionally refuses to restore port 1235 even if it is stored: that
is where engine-manager runs a managed LM Studio, so a proxy restoring it would
sit on the engine's own port. The stored value predates the current default.

**Browser clients (CORS).** PAIR does not enable CORS or add default browser permissions. Configure origins through the engine; its built-in defaults and user configuration remain authoritative. Ordinary forwarded responses preserve the upstream status, body, and CORS headers, including missing headers. A denial is never replaced with a successful OPTIONS response or retried to find permission elsewhere. Proxy-generated errors carry their actual status without CORS permission headers, so browser JavaScript may see a generic CORS failure while curl and diagnostics show the real error.

Above that per-engine policy sits a request-entry allowlist gate. The loopback listener is reachable by a browser page on any origin, and a simple cross-origin POST needs no preflight, so header policy alone cannot stop an unlisted page from driving the local engines. Browser callers (a request carrying an `Origin`) are therefore admitted only from exact origins the operator lists in `NVPAIR_PROXY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated, scheme+host[:port], compared exactly); with no entry configured, every browser origin is refused with `403` `origin-not-allowed` before it can reach a candidate or reserve capacity. Non-browser callers (the Electron main process, CLI tools, health probes) send no `Origin` and are unaffected. The gate only admits or refuses; what an admitted origin may then read is still the engines' own intersection policy below.

A browser preflight (OPTIONS with Origin and Access-Control-Request-Method) queries every currently routable target, with concurrency eight, a ten-second query deadline, and no redirects. A single target's response is relayed. Multiple responding targets must all permit the requested origin, method, and headers; PAIR grants only their shared permissions. Credentials require unanimous explicit support. Synthesized preflights allow browsers to cache the result for 60 seconds; PAIR itself does not cache decisions. A policy denial returns 403. Unavailable targets are skipped; if none can answer, the proxy returns 502. Ordinary OPTIONS requests retain normal routing. Preflights do not create inference jobs or reserve scheduler capacity. Paired ingress forwards only to its local engine.

Combined model lists forward the caller's origin and end-to-end headers, excluding Authorization and Cookie so credentials are not shared across engines. Multi-target preflights apply the same credential filtering. With an Origin header, every responding engine must return a valid list and permit sharing: one denial returns 403 and one invalid list returns 502, without partial inventory. An invalid-list error retains the combined CORS permissions when every responding engine allows the origin. Unavailable engines are skipped, with 502 returned when none can answer. Successful lists combine origin/credential permissions and Vary requirements. Requests without Origin retain partial aggregation when some inventories are unavailable. Engines without CORS support remain unavailable to cross-origin browser clients through PAIR.

Both engine facades use nvpair-shared/cors. Neither facade reads engine environment variables or parses launch commands to determine CORS policy.

One limit is outside the proxy's control: current Chromium-based browsers gate a request from a public origin to a local or loopback address behind the user's [Local Network Access](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5152728072060928) permission, which replaced the old server-side opt-in header. No header the proxy sends can grant that. A hosted page needs the permission plus a `fetch(url, { targetAddressSpace: 'loopback' })` annotation; a page served from the local machine is unaffected.

### Node selection

- **Eligibility**: Before routing model-bearing inference, the proxy keeps only
  nodes whose current inventory for this engine advertises the requested model,
  compared using the engine's naming rule. An empty or non-matching inventory is
  excluded until a later discovery update; if no advertised owner is routable,
  the proxy returns a local `502`.
- **Auto**: When no eligible node is explicitly selected, the proxy follows
  `node/set-priority`, then discovered nodes in stable ID order.
- **Priority (scheduler-driven)**: The Job Scheduler ranks the cluster
  least-loaded-first by pending workload plus smoothed GPU pressure and, via
  `nvpair-ui-broker`, pushes the ordered node list with those per-node counts to
  this proxy with `node/set-priority`. Auto routing sends the request to the
  listed node carrying the least estimated load. See
  [`nvpair-job-scheduler`](../nvpair-job-scheduler/README.md).
- **Manual**: `node/select` pins traffic to a specific node. A manual pin
  **overrides the priority list only when that node is eligible** for the
  requested model.
- **Failover**: If the selected node disappears from the discovery set, the
  proxy falls back to auto-select and emits `node/selection-changed`. A
  transport error or retryable status, including a model `404` from an
  advertised owner with stale inventory, steps to the next eligible owner.
  Once a round's owners are used up, an inference request re-resolves and keeps
  trying under a dispatch budget and a wall-clock deadline, and it commits to a
  node at the first byte of response body rather than at its headers. `spec.md`
  §5.1–§5.4 is normative for the bounds, the commit point, and the statuses.

### IPC Transport

By default the proxy communicates over **stdin/stdout** using newline-delimited
JSON-RPC 2.0 (one message per line). All diagnostic logging goes to **stderr**.

For environments where stdout may conflict with the host process (e.g. Electron),
pass `--ipc` to redirect the JSON-RPC channel to a named socket or pipe. The
parent process should create and listen on the endpoint before spawning the
proxy.

```bash
# Default: stdin/stdout
nvpair-proxy

# Unix domain socket
nvpair-proxy --ipc /tmp/nvpair-proxy.sock

# Windows named pipe
nvpair-proxy --ipc \\.\pipe\nvpair-proxy
```

## JSON-RPC 2.0 Protocol

The control channel is identical for every engine; only the broker's relay
prefix differs. The generated method surface — every request and notification,
with payload shapes — is in
[`desktop/docs/services-api.md`](../../desktop/docs/services-api.md), produced by
`npm --prefix desktop run service-contracts:write`. Read that rather than a
hand-maintained copy, which is how the two per-engine READMEs drifted.

The proxy emits `ready` on startup carrying its bound port, which is the
authoritative source of where it is listening — do not assume a port before it
reports one.

## Shutdown

Closing stdin (observed as EOF) drains the HTTP server and exits. The broker
owns the lifecycle: `shutdown` relayed from a client is refused.

## Adding an engine

Add one entry to `nvpair-shared/engines` for the cross-process identity, one to
`engines.go` here for the proxy-only values, and one to the broker's
`engineproxy.go` for its ownership. See the "Adding a new engine" section of the
proxy-unification plan for the full checklist, including the one-liners that are
still per-engine (a `noderec.ServiceKey`, the TUI health label, the desktop
engine-type constants, and an engine-manager manifest).
